#  Radar Signal Processing on Zynq SoCs for Doppler Estimation

A research internship project at IIIT Delhi focused on accelerating classical and deep-learning-based Doppler estimation techniques on Zynq FPGA platforms (PYNQ-Z2 and ZCU111) using Vivado HLS, PYNQ, and PyTorch.

---

## Objective

To explore latencyâ€“resource trade-offs in real-time radar pipelines by implementing algorithms like MUSIC, ESPRIT, and SubspaceNet using both hardware-accelerated (HLS, Verilog) and software-based (Python, PyTorch) approaches.

## Resume Extract

**â€¢ Radar Signal Processing on Zynq SoCs for Doppler Estimation (Marâ€™25- ONGOING)**
Research Intern, Algorithms to Architecture (A2A) lab, IIIT Delhi (Prof. Sumit J. Darak, Dept of ECE, IIITD)

Objective: To accelerate and compare classical and deep-learning-aided doppler estimation algorithms to evaluate latencyâ€“resource trade-offs in real-time radar systems on FPGAs of Zynq-SoCs (Pynq-Z2 and ZCU111).

Approach: â€¢ Developed custom HLS IPs and integrated PYNQ drivers via Vivado block design using AXI4 interfaces.
â€¢ Implemented MUSIC and ESPRIT as Vitis HLS IPs with resource optimizations like word-length tuning.
â€¢ Benchmarked HLS design pragmas like pipeline, unroll, and array partitioning using synthesis reports.
â€¢ Compared performance of single, double-precision float and fixed data types for Doppler-separated targets.
â€¢ Integrated deep neural networks (DNNs) to boost accuracy under coherent sources and array miscalibration.
â€¢ Used Integrated Logic Analyzers to debug AXI transactions and verify dataflow correctness on hardware

Impact: â€¢ Achieved up to 4x acceleration over NumPy in FPGA-accelerated matrix multiplication on ZCU111.
â€¢ Created a 4-part YouTube tutorial series on HLS-to-PYNQ design flow and benchmarking on Vitis 2024.2.
â€¢ Attained a 30x acceleration over NumPy for reliable Doppler estimation using MUSIC and ESPRIT


Note:
The internship was on-site, where I worked in the Algorithms to Architecture (A2A) lab, guided by Aakanksha Tewari and Prof. Darak. The initial weeks, while I was in college, were remote where I underwent training to understand the Vivado workflow and how HLS works.
