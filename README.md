**• FPGA-Based Radar Signal Processing on Zynq SoC (Mar’25- July'25)**
Research Intern, IIIT Delhi (Prof. Sumit J. Darak, Dept of ECE, IIITD)


– Designed and implemented high-performance FPGA architectures for radar signal processing using Xilinx Vivado
HLS & Verilog RTL.
– Accelerated signal processing algorithms by translating C-based models into hardware-optimized Verilog using HLS-based
DSP pipelines.
– Integrated HLS-generated modules with ARM-based embedded processing on Xilinx Zynq SoC, leveraging AXI
interfaces for efficient data transfer.
– Optimized resource utilization, power consumption and latency for real-time radar applications.
– Developed Python-based driver software to test and verify hardware performance



The internship was on-site, where I worked in the lab, guided by Aakanksha Tewari and Prof. Darak. The initial weeks, while I was in college, were remote where I underwent training to understand the Vivado workflow and how HLS works.
